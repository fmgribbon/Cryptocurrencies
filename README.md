## Purpose 
   To create a report and group traded cryptocurrencies available in the market given the features of each cryptocurrency. The unsupervised learning K-Means clustering algorithm was used to cluster the cryptocurrencies data. The PCA algorithm was utilized to  reduce the dimension of the data, before data clustering. The elbow method was used to determine the optimum number of clusters(K). The cryptocurrencies were classified into 4 groups (clusters).
